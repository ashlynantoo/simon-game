# simon-game

A memory game that has four colored buttons, each producing a particular sound when it is pressed or activated. In each round, the buttons will be activated in a random order. The player will have to reproduce the same order by pressing the buttons. The number of buttons to be pressed increases as the game progresses. If the user fails to reproduce the same order, then game is over.

This game helps to improve the memory of the player.
